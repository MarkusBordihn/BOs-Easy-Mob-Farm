## Custom Loot tables ðŸ“¦

The mod is using the provided loot tables from the mods.
This means if you adjust the loot tables for data files these changes are automatically considered by this mod as well.

### ðŸ¤º Killed by Player Loot Drops

The `killed_by_player` loot drops will be only considered if an weapon (sword), is placed in the weapon slot.
The item will be consumed by each drop, but it will also increase the loot luck by 20%.

## Collect Experience

Experience could be collected by placing a empty bottle or experience bottle into the experience slot.
The experience will be generated randomly, so not on each drop.
